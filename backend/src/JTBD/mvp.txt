Implementation Plan: V1 Product with Feature Flags
Executive Summary
This document outlines our approach for implementing the V1 product focused only on Manager and User roles, without organization management or admin capabilities. The plan establishes a feature flag system allowing easy activation of multi-organization support later, and implements a team member invitation system for managers.
1. Feature Flag Architecture
Purpose
Create a feature flag system that allows us to disable organizations and admin roles initially while maintaining the existing data model, ensuring an easy transition in the future.
Implementation
Create environment variables to control feature flags
Build a centralized configuration module for both frontend and backend
Default all users to a single organization behind the scenes
Key Flags
ENABLE_ORGANIZATIONS: Controls multi-organization features
ENABLE_ADMIN_ROLE: Controls admin-specific UI and functionality
2. Default Organization Setup
Database Approach
Create one master organization during initial database setup
Assign all users to this organization automatically
Maintain existing schema and data relationships
User Assignment Process
Auto-assign all new users to default organization during registration
Ensure auth middleware assigns default organization ID when feature is disabled
Modify user creation and Clerk webhook handlers to respect feature flag
3. Frontend Modifications
UI Adaptations
Modify organization check wrapper to bypass organization validation
Conditionally render admin-specific UI sections based on feature flags
Authentication Flow
Maintain existing auth flow but skip organization choice screens
Ensure feature flag is checked before any organization-related UI is shown
4. Backend Adjustments
Access Control
Modify access control services to use default organization when feature is disabled
Maintain security boundaries based on manager hierarchies within the default organization
Ensure queries consistently filter by organization ID even when feature is disabled
API Endpoints
Update organization-dependent endpoints to use default organization ID
Add feature flag checks to bypass organization validation when appropriate
5. Manager Team Invitation System Implementation Plan
Database Model
Create Invitation table with fields for status, expiry date, team assignment, and manager reference
Add indexes for efficient querying by manager and status
Clerk Integration
Use Clerk's user invitation API for the authentication aspect
Implement custom logic to track invitation counts and enforce manager limits
Store additional invitation metadata in our database
Modify Clerk webhooks to handle invitation acceptance events
Backend APIs
Create endpoints to manage custom invitation tracking
Implement invitation count validation (max 3 active per manager)
Add expiration logic (7-day TTL)
Respect organization feature flag in all operations
SendGrid Integration
Use Clerk's email service or integrate SendGrid for custom invitation emails
Create templates with secure acceptance links (via Clerk)
Add tracking for invitation status
Frontend Components
Create invitation form with Clerk API integration
Implement status indicators and remaining quota display
Add revocation functionality
Acceptance Flow
Leverage Clerk's secure authentication for user signup
Connect new user accounts to the appropriate team/organization
Implement default organization assignment based on feature flag
Testing
Verify invitation limits
Test expiration functionality
Validate Clerk integration
Ensure proper feature flag handling
6. Testing Strategy
Verify all features work with organization feature flag off
Test database integrity with feature flags in both states
Ensure invitation system honors the 3-invitation limit
Validate proper role assignment during invitation acceptance
7. Future Enablement Process
Organization Feature Enablement
Set environment variables to enable organizations
Deploy configuration changes
No code changes or migrations required
Organization management UI will appear automatically
Admin Role Enablement
Set environment variable to enable admin role
Deploy configuration changes
Admin-specific UI and functionality will become available
8. Documentation & Training
Create user guide explaining manager invitation process
Document feature flag system for development team
Prepare future documentation for organization management features
This implementation approach minimizes development effort while providing a clear path to the full-featured product in future versions.
